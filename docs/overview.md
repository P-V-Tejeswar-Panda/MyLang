# Language Implementation -- A Scan of the territory
## What are the parts of a language ?
### Scanning / Lexing
Scanning or Lexing is the act of processing a stream of characters and chunking then into tokens. Each token has two parts to it:
1. The token type
2. The token value.

Ex:
```
var average = (min + max) / 2;
Becomes:
+-----+ +---------+ +---+ +---+ +-----+ +---+ +-----+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
| var | | average | | = | | ( | | min | | + | | max | | ) | | / | | 2 | | ; |
+-----+ +---------+ +---+ +---+ +-----+ +---+ +-----+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
Each of these boxes is a token.
```

### Parsing
A parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and a applies the language's grammar to create a tree like structure called the parse tree or the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST).

```
                    +---------+
      stmt.Var      | Average |
                    +---------+
                         |
                       +---+
         Expr.Binary   | / |
                       +---+
                        /\
                       /  \
                      /    \
                    +-+    +-+
        Expr.Binary |+|    |2| Expr.Literal
                    +-+    +-+
                    /\
                   /  \
                  /    \
                +---+  +---+
  Expr.Varibale |min|  |max| Expr.Variable
                +---+  +---+
```
